## `Overview of the MechaCar Statistical Analysis`	
	
The purpose for the MechaCAr project is to to review the production data for insights that may help the manufacturing teams:
  - Linear Regression to Predict MPG. Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.
  - Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils. Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
  - T-Test on Suspension Coils. Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
  - Design a Study Comparing the MechaCar to the Competition. Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. 

## `Resources`	
The analysis is created using next software: R-Studio, .

### `- Linear Regression to Predict MPG`	
The result of that can be found in the [MechaCarChallenge](./MechaCarChallenge.R) file.	

rite a short summary using a screenshot of the output from the linear regression, and address the following questions:

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

### `- Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils`	

The MechaCar Suspension_Coil.csv dataset contains the results from multiple production lots. In this dataset, the weight capacities of multiple suspension coils were tested to determine if the manufacturing process is consistent across production lots.. Create a summary statistics table to show:

- The suspension coilâ€™s PSI continuous variable across all manufacturing lots
- The following PSI metrics for each lot: mean, median, variance, and standard deviation

write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

perform t-tests to determine if all manufacturing lots and each lot individually are statistically different from the population mean of 1,500 pounds per square inch


 briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary

In the written summaries, we would like you to think critically about your analysis, not demonstrate mastery of automotive manufacturing.

The analysis provides a lot of summarizing.
